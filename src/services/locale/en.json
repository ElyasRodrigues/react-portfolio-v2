      "I know it's pretty clich√©, but since I was very young, I've always been fascinated by technology, spending hours in front of a screen. Whenever I used something technology related, from a simple calculator to a 'modern' computer, I always asked myself: 'how does this work?'. Until I got to know programming, and from that moment on it didn't take long to discover that this was what I wanted for my life. I am currently improving my skills and knowledge in the most requested front-end technologies.",
